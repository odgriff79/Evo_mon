## Model-Specific Analysis

### Met Office (UK National)

- Strengthening easterly winds over Christmas
- Temperatures below average but not exceptionally cold
- Frost and fog likely where clear skies and light winds prevail
- Post-Christmas settled through New Year

### ECMWF (European Centre)
- 51-member ensemble shows tight clustering = high confidence
- Unsettled mild pattern persisting early week
- Clear signal for high pressure dominance Christmas onwards
- Low spread in temperature forecasts (high agreement)

### GFS (American Model)
- 31-member ensemble consistent with European models
- Shows similar high pressure pattern
- Some divergence in New Year precipitation timing
- Generally drier solution than ECMWF for Dec 27-30

### GEM (Canadian Model)
- 21-member ensemble
- Agrees on main pattern (high pressure Christmas)
- Slightly cooler temperatures in longer range
- Similar precipitation outlook

## Key Divergences (Where Models Disagree)

### Post-New Year (Jan 1-3)
- **GFS:** Keeps high pressure, dry conditions continuing
- **ECMWF:** Suggests wet weather may spread from west

**Impact:** Low confidence for Jan 1-3 precipitation forecasts

### Exact Timing of Cold Spell
- All models agree cooling trend, but differ by ~12-24 hours on exact timing
- Minimal practical impact
